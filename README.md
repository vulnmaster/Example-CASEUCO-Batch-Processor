#Problem: CASE/UCO adopters need to serialize outputs from command line tools into .jsonld. In our use case, adopters are not able to run any database (e.g., graph database) as part of the technology stack. An example program would be a file carving application that carves terabytes of information in a stream and needs to output UCO-compliant .jsonld. 

Instructions:

To handle large datasets efficiently and prevent memory issues, you can use several strategies:

Batch Processing: Process and serialize data in smaller batches rather than loading all data into memory at once.

Streaming: Use streaming techniques to handle large data sets incrementally.
Efficient Data Structures: Ensure that your data structures and serialization methods are optimized for memory usage.

Garbage Collection: Explicitly trigger garbage collection to free up unused memory.
Here's an enhanced approach using batch processing and streaming to manage memory usage efficiently. We'll process the data in chunks and write each chunk to the output file incrementally.


Modify the CASEUCO class in uco_serialization to support batch processing and incremental writing of the jsonld output.

Explanation

Batch Processing: The input data is processed in batches defined by batch_size.

Graph Reset: After each batch is serialized and written to the output file, the RDF graph is reset to free up memory.

Incremental Writing: The serialize_graph function appends each batch's serialized data to the output file.

Usage
Save the altered CASEUCO code to a file named uco_serialization.py.

Simulate an input data file with records to be processed in batches.

Run the script from the command line:

python case_uco.py --input input_data.json --batch_size 1000 --output case_output.jsonld
